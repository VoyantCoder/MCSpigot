            Minecraft Spigot based Plugins

        <p>
            This repository contains all of my Minecraft plugins I actively maintain. Some of these have been made in collaboration with someone while others have been made solitarily. These plugins are used on my server and can thus be experienced there. Find more info <a href='https://pugpawz.com'>here</a> if you are interested. If you are here early, yes there is nothing here yet. But believe me, it will be filled up very soon!
